# Building a release

To build a release of cozy-stack, a `build.sh` script can automate the work. The
`release` option of this script will generate a binary with a name containing
the version of the file, along with a SHA-256 sum of the binary.

You can use a `local.env` at the root of the repository to add your default
values for environment variables.

See `./scripts/build.sh --help` for more informations.

```sh
COZY_ENV=development GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 ./scripts/build.sh release
```

The version string is deterministic and reflects entirely the state of the
working-directory from which the release is built from. It is generated using
the following format:

        <TAG>[-<NUMBER OF COMMITS AFTER TAG>][-dirty][-dev]

Where:

* `<TAG>`: closest annotated tag of the current working directory. If no tag is
  present, is uses the string "v0". This is not allowed in a production release.
* `<NUMBER OF COMMITS AFTER TAG>`: number of commits after the closest tag if
  the current working directory does not point exactly to a tag
* `dirty`: added if the working if the working-directory is not clean (contains
  un-commited modifications). This is not allowed in production release.
* `dev`: added for a development mode release

# Sprint release

At the end of a sprint, we release different versions of the stack:

  - "Naked" stack, for GNU/Linux amd64/arm and FreeBSD amd64
    - Create a tag `yyyyMmSs` and push it
    - Generate all binaries, checksums and signatures with `./scripts/release.sh`
    - Create a GitHub release and upload all previously generated assets with `./scripts/release.rb`

  - Docker development image
    - Copy `cozy-stack` GNU/Linux amd64 binary to `./scripts`
    - Go into `./scripts`
    - Generate docker image with `docker build -t cozy/cozy-app-dev:<tag>`
    - Push image to the Docker hub with `docker push cozy/cozy-app-dev:<tag>`

  - Debian self-hosting packages
    - Create a new version `yyyyMmSs-1` on https://github.com/cozy/debian-cozy/blob/master/changelog
    - Create and push a tag `yyyyMmSs-1` on `https://github.com/cozy/debian-cozy`
    - Build and publish packages on our internal build machine
