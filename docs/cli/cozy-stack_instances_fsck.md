## cozy-stack instances fsck

Check a vfs

### Synopsis


The cozy-stack fsck command checks that the files in the VFS are not
desynchronized, ie a file present in CouchDB but not swift/localfs, or present
in swift/localfs but not couchdb.

There are 2 steps:

- index integrity checks that there are nothing wrong in the index (CouchDB),
  like a file present in a directory that has been deleted
- files consistency checks that the files are the same in the index (CouchDB)
  and the storage (Swift or localfs).

By default, both operations are done, but you can choose one or the other via
the flags.


```
cozy-stack instances fsck <domain> [flags]
