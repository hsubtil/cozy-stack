# JSON-API

## Introduction

Except for the routes in `/data`, which imitate couchdb, most of the stack
exposes a JSON-API interface.

See [JSON-API specification](http://jsonapi.org/format/) for more information.

## Pagination

All routes that return a list are (or will be) paginated.

As recommended for couchdb, we use **cursor-based** pagination.

The default page limit is determined on a by-route basis. The client can require
a different limit using `page[limit]` query parameter. If the client does not
specify a limit, default limit will be used instead.

If there is more docs after the limit, the response will contain a `next` key in
its links section, with a `page[cursor]` set to fetch docs starting after the
last one from current request.

Alternatively, the client can opt in for skip mode by using `page[skip]`. When
using skip, the number given in `page[skip]` is number of element ignored before
returning value. Similarly, the response will contain a next link with a
`page[skip]` set for next page (skip + limit).

### Example

The `/relationships/references` as a default limit of 100.

```http
GET /data/some-type/some-id/relationships/references HTTP/1.1
```

```json
{
  "data": ["... 100 docs ..."],
  "links": {
    "next":
      "/data/some-type/some-id/relationships/references?page[limit]=100&page[cursor]=7845122548848454212"
  }
}
```

```http
GET /data/some-type/some-id/relationships/references?page[limit]=10 HTTP/1.1
```

```json
{
  "data": ["... 10 docs ..."],
  "links": {
    "next":
      "/data/some-type/some-id/relationships/references?page[limit]=10&page[cursor]=5487ba7596"
  }
}
```

```http
GET /data/some-type/some-id/relationships/references?page[limit]=100&page[cursor]=7845122548848454212 HTTP/1.1
```

```json
{
  "data": ["... 20 docs ..."]
}
```

```http
GET /data/some-type/some-id/relationships/references?page[limit]=10&page[skip]=0 HTTP/1.1
```

```json
{
  "data": ["... 10 docs ..."],
  "links": {
    "next":
      "/data/some-type/some-id/relationships/references?page[limit]=10&page[skip]=10"
  }
}
```
