# CouchDB Quirks

## Mango indexes

### Exists operator

The [`$exists`
operator](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/api/database/find.html#condition-operators)
can be used with a mango index for the `true` value, but not for the `false`
value. For `false`, a more heavy solution is required: [a partial
index](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/api/database/find.html#find-partial-indexes).

### Index selection

CouchDB may accept or refuse to use a mango index for a query, with obsure
reasons. In general, you can follow these two rules of thumb:

1. An index on the fields `foo, bar, baz` can be used only to fetch documents
   where `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` exist. It means that a query that filters only
   on the value on `foo` won't use the mango index, because it can miss a
   document where `foo` has the expected value but without `bar` or `baz`. If
   you know that all the documents that you want have the `bar` and `baz`
   fields, you can just add two filters `$exists: true` (one for `bar`, the
   other for `baz`).

2. You should use exactly the same sequence of fields for creating the index
   and the `sort` operator of the query. If you have an index on `os, browser,
   ip` for the `io.cozy.sessions.logins`, and you want to have all the
   documents for a login from `windows`, sorted by `browser`, you can use the
   index, but you should use `os, browser, ip` for the sort (or at least `os,
   browser`, even if it is seems to weird to sort on `os` when all the sorted
   documents will have the same value, `windows`). Please note that using
   `use_index` on a request, the results will be sorted by default according
   to this rule. So, you can omit the `sort` operator on the query (except if
   you want the `descending` order).


## Old revisions

CouchDB keeps for each document a list of its revision (or more exactly a tree
with replication and conflicts).

It's possible to ask the list of the old revisions of a document with [`GET
/db/{docid}?revs_info=true`](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/api/document/common.html#get--db-docid).
It works only if the document has not been deleted. For a deleted document, [a
trick](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10854883/retrieve-just-deleted-document/10857330#10857330)
is to query the changes feed to know the last revision of the document, and to
recreate the document from this revision.

With an old revision, it's possible to get the content of the document at this
revision with `GET /db/{docid}?rev={rev}` if the database was not compacted.
On CouchDB 2.x, compacts happen automatically on all databases from times to
times.

A `purge` operation consists to remove the tombstone for the deleted
documents. It is a manual operation, triggered by a
[`POST /db/_purge`](http://docs.couchdb.org/en/2.1.1/api/database/misc.html).


## Conflicts

It is possible to create a conflict on CouchDB like it does for the
replication by using `new_edits`, but it is not well documented to say the
least. The more accurate description is on the old wiki:
https://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/HTTP_Bulk_Document_API#Posting_Existing_Revisions.

In short, it's a `PUT /doc/{id}?new_edits=false` with `_rev` the new revision
of the document, and `_revisions` the parents of this revision in the
revisions tree of this document.
