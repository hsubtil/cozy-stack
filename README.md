## What is Cozy? 

![Cozy Logo](https://cdn.rawgit.com/cozy/cozy-guidelines/master/templates/cozy_logo_small.svg)

[Cozy](https://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space. With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own
hardware where no one profiles you.


## And what about this repository?

This repository contains the new version of Cozy Cloud which aims to be
simpler for hosting thousands of instances. It should also bring for the
self-hosted the possibility to host several instances on the same server, and
improve many things, starting with security and reliability.
